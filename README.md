# TableLink

TableLink is an online platform designed to streamline the restaurant reservation, ordering, and service process. It allows users to create an account, browse and select a restaurant, and make a reservation for a table. Once at the restaurant, the waiter can use the platform to take the user's order, which is then passed on to the chef for preparation. When the food is ready, the chef marks the order as completed, and the waiter is notified to serve it to the user.
